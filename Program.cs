            //A generated key, registered in the GoogleAPI project, anyone who brings the key (http header or queryparam) have access to the hoster's public data, or "link-shared" data.
            //As of 2020.04.08 it's not working for writes anymore, since all nd every write requires Authentication, and API Key is not proper Authentication.

            //OAuth:
            //Auditible permissions system, with pre-configured permissions, reviewed by google. If the permissions dont include Restricted or Sensitive data, the review process is less painful.
            //Otherwise it takes weeks and possibly a bag of money. 
            //This is when an app tries to access a resouce of the owner (liek a spreadsheet) and a popup asks for agreement from the user on the private data authorizations (these ae base on the scopes.)
            //More at: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914?hl=en

            //Service Accounts
            //It's basically an non-user dependent google account, so it is supposed to be used by an App exlusively as a resource, so no user permissions are needed, as the data does not belong to a user, thus: "Service" Account.
            //Keep in mind, any fiels created trough a Service Account belongs to the Service Account, not to you, meaning you dond have read permissions as "kovacs.bela@gmail.com", unless its not provided trough the Service Account.
            //A workaround is to create a google doc, and share it with a Service Account.
            //Since Service Account generated / permitted files are not user dependent, access any rights can be acquired only by defining the Scopes. In this example we use Drive.all
